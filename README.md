# Hangman
A letter-guessing game played by 1-8 players. Players are given a random hidden word and are tasked to guess its letters. If they guess correctly, all instances of the guessed letter are revealed. If they guess incorrectly, the "man" gets one step closed to hanging. If the number of allowed incorrect guesses is exhausted, the man is hung and the team loses the game. Each player on the team has a score on the scoreboard according to his number of correct guesses.

Requires pygame module to be installed.
